# TextConverterGUI
That is a Version of my project but with a Window instead of a Command Line interface.

Make sure you have each required module installed that is gonna be listed in a text file that tells what modules are required to be installed from a fresh Python 3 install

INFO: The Readme is currently incomplete and may change in the future!

UPDATE: This repository is now a public Archive. This repoisitory is not getting updates anymore!!! The code of this Repository is going to be merged to https://github.com/Chaosminecraft/Text-converter

The Merge is gonna take a good while to bring it up to snuff and I first focus on Function and then later on focus on making it pretty. Please be patient.
